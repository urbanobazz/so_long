# so_long
Embark on a thrilling adventure with so_long, a simple 2D game where the player navigates a maze-like environment, evading obstacles to reach the ultimate goal. Crafted using the MiniLibX library, this project challenged me to delve into game mechanics, file I/O operations, and fundamental graphics programming. Through its development, I acquired skills in game design principles, file handling techniques, and the implementation of graphical interfaces, advancing my growth as a developer.
